# KChingu
A Kdrama Recommendation App

- KChingu is an interactive recommendation app powered by machine learning.
- It utilizes the Bag of Words technique, a natural language processing approach, to analyze the textual features of Korean dramas (K-dramas) such as the synopsis, genre, tags, director, and screenwriter information.
- The app applies cosine similarity, a mathematical measure, to calculate the similarity between different K-dramas based on their textual features.
- Users can select a K-drama they like, and the app generates a curated list of similar K-dramas using the machine learning model.
- The app provides a seamless user experience with clickable posters and direct links to official websites, enabling users to explore and learn more about the recommended K-dramas.

By combining machine learning techniques with user preferences, KChingu offers personalized recommendations, allowing users to discover new K-dramas that align with their interests and preferences.
