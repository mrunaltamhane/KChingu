# KChingu
A Kdrama Recommendation App

KChingu is an interactive recommendation app built using machine learning techniques. It suggests Korean dramas (K-dramas) based on user preferences and similarities between different dramas. Users can select a K-drama they like, and the app generates a curated list of similar K-dramas they might enjoy. The app provides a seamless user experience with clickable posters and direct links to official websites for more information. It leverages the power of machine learning to offer personalized recommendations and help users discover new K-dramas they'll love.
